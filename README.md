Poker Pre-Flop Equity Calculator

Equity Calculator was made using C++ , OpenMP , and a hand evaluator library.

Developed a poker pre-flop calculator using C++ and OpenMP. This project was particularly exciting as it required integrating various programming concepts to solve a real-world problem.

Using C++ objects to represent the deck, flop, and hands, I created a simulation loop. This loop allowed for the random selection of flops and determination of hand rankings. 

Using OpenMP for parallel processing enabled me to distribute simulations across several processes, leading to significant performance enhancements. By summing up win totals across these simulations, the calculator provided win percentage estimations between hands. This experience reinforced my problem-solving skills and showcased the power of technology in facilitating complex analysis and decision-making

Video below demonstrates program usage and speed comparison between sequential and parallel versions.
